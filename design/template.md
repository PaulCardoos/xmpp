## Background

A longer description explaining what is being proposed in more detail, but also
why it is needed and the history of the issue or the feature in Mellium if
applicable, as well as any necessary background information required to fully
understand and evaluate the proposal.


## Requirements

- This will likely be a bulleted list
- Each requirement should be met by the proposal in the next section


## Proposal

The actual proposal.
This should include the entire public API and a summary of what this will mean
for compatibility and maintenance overhead going forward.
For example, it might include the various types, functions and methods in a
fenced code block.
This is a good place to go ahead and think about your documentation and how you
will explain to users what your types, methods, and functions do and how they
should use them.
For example:

```
// Cmd is an external command being prepared or run.
type Cmd struct {
	*exec.Cmd
	â€¦
}

	// New creates a new, unstarted, command.
	func New(ctx context.Context, name string, opts ...Option) (*Cmd, error)

	// Close kills the command if it is still running and cleans up any
	// temporary resources that were created.
	func (cmd *Cmd) Close() error

	// ConfigDir returns the temporary directory used to store config files.
	func (cmd *Cmd) ConfigDir() string

	// Dial attempts to connect to the server by dialing localhost and then
	// negotiating a stream with the location set to the domainpart of j and the
	// origin set to j.
	func (cmd *Cmd) Dial(ctx context.Context, j jid.JID, t *testing.T, features ...xmpp.StreamFeature) (*xmpp.Session, error)
```
