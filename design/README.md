# Proposals and Design Documents

When working on a large change, you may be asked to first submit a design
document to make the change easier to understand and evaluate.
A template for proposals and design documents may be found in the file
[template.md].

The process involves:

1. Creating an issue at https://mellium.im/issue
2. A discussion on the issue tracker that may result in a request for a design
   document
3. The proposal author writes a design doc to work out any details and open
   issues and make the proposal more concrete
4. The design doc may go through several revisions and further discussion
5. The proposal is accepted or declined

Finally, if accepted, the proposal may be implemented and the patch set merged!

If you need help with this process, feel free to join the
[chat room](https://mellium.chat).
